## Getting Started

To get started with Python data types, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Example Code

### Numeric Data Types

```python
x = 10         # Integer
a = 3.14      # Float
```

### String Data Type

```python
name = "Alice"
greeting = f'Hello, {name}'
```

### List Data Type

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
fruits.append("watermelon")
```

### Tuple Data Type

```python
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
```

### Dictionary Data Type

```python
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 20,
    "major": "Computer Science"
}
```

### Boolean Data Type

```python
is_adult = student["age"] > 18
print(is_adult)
```

## Conclusion
Understanding the various data types in Python will help you write more effective code and handle information more easily. Happy coding!
