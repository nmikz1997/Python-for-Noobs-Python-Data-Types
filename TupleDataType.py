# A tuple is also an ordered collection, but unlike lists, the items in a tuple cannot be changed (immutable). Tuples are enclosed in parentheses. For example:
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
print(coordinates)

# You can access items in a tuple just like in a list:
x_coordinate = coordinates[0]  # Result is 10.0
print(x_coordinate)
